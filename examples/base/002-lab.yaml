# Jeff and Jim share a datalab s-jeff with one default shared session
# automatically created. That session will run permanently until stopped by the operator.
# The lab does not use a vcluster and has no workshop files.
# Credentials to storage are expected to exist in a secret "jeff" in the same namespace.
# A Keycloak group, role, and client are created; users "jeff" and "jim" must exist in Keycloak.
# This configuration runs the lab in privileged mode:
# - Security policy: "privileged" â†’ automatically enables Docker with 20 Gi workspace storage.
# - Kubernetes API access is disabled (kubernetesAccess=false).
