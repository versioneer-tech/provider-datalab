# Joe gets a personal datalab s-joe with no pre-created session.
# He must explicitly start a session himself; nothing is running by default.
# No vcluster is provisioned and no workshop files are attached.
# Credentials to storage are expected to exist in a secret "joe" in the same namespace.
# A Keycloak group, role, and client are created; user "joe" must exist in Keycloak.
